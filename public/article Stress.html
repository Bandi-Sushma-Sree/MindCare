            <h2>Stress: An Overview</h2>
            <p>Stress is the body's response to physical, mental, or emotional pressure. It's a normal part of life, but when it becomes chronic or overwhelming, it can have negative effects on your health and well-being.</p>
            
            <h3>What is stress?</h3>
            <p>Stress is your body's way of responding to any kind of demand or threat. When you sense danger—whether it's real or imagined—the body's defenses kick into high gear in a rapid, automatic process known as the "fight-or-flight" reaction or the "stress response."</p>
