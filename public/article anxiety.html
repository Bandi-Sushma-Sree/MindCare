      <h2>Anxiety Disorders</h2>
      <p>Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions that cause fear, dread, and 
        other symptoms that are out of proportion to the situation. There are several types, 
        including generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobias, and social anxiety disorder. 
        Treatment is effective and usually includes medication and psychotherapy (talk therapy).</p>
      
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>What is an anxiety disorder?</h3>
      <p>An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder, 
        you may respond to certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience 
        physical signs of anxiety, such as a pounding heart and sweating.</p>
      
      <p>It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a
         problem at work, go to an interview, take a test, or make an important decision. Some 
         anxiety can even be beneficial — it helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention so we stay safe.</p>
      
      <p>But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel
        
        from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when:</p>
      
      <ol class="bullet-list">
        <li>Anxiety interferes with your ability to function.</li>
        <li>Your reactions are often out of proportion to situations (overreactions).</li>
        <li>You can’t control your responses to situations.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>Children, adolescents, and adults can experience anxiety disorders. Women and people assigned
         female at birth are about twice as likely as men and people assigned male at birth to have one.</p>
      
      <p>Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the day. Fortunately, there are several effective
         treatments for these conditions.</p>
  <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
  <h3>How are anxiety disorders treated?</h3>
  <p>An anxiety disorder is like any other health condition that requires treatment.
     You can’t will it away. It’s not a matter of self-discipline or attitude. 
     Researchers have made a lot of progress in the last few decades in treating mental 
     health conditions. Your healthcare provider will tailor a treatment plan that works for you. 
     Your plan may include a combination of medication and psychotherapy .</p>
     <h2>Medication for anxiety disorders</h2>
     <p>Medications can’t cure an anxiety disorder. But they can improve the symptoms
       and help you function better. Medications for anxiety disorders often include:</p>
       <ol class="bullet-list">
        <li><span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Antidepressants</span>: 
          While they mainly treat depression, these medications can also help with anxiety disorders.
           They adjust how your brain uses certain chemicals to improve mood and reduce stress. 
           Antidepressants</span> 
           may take some time to work, so try to be patient. SSRIs and SNRIs are the go-to types of 
          
           for anxiety. Tricyclic  are another option, but they cause more side effects.</li>
           <li><span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Benzodiazepines</span>:This class of medications
             may decrease your anxiety, panic and worry. They work quickly, but you can build up a tolerance to them.
              They also have addiction potential, so you have to take them cautiously. Your healthcare provider may 
              prescribe a benzodiazepine for the short term, then taper you off. Benzodiazepines that can help treat
               anxiety disorders include alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam and lorazepam. </li>
               <li><span style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">Beta-blockers</span>:These medications can help
                 reduce some of the physical symptoms of anxiety disorders, like rapid heartbeat, shaking and trembling. 
                 They don’t treat the psychological aspects of anxiety disorders.</li>
                 </ol>
                 <p>Your healthcare provider will work with you to find the right medication combination and dosage.
                   Don’t change the dose or stop taking medications without talking to your provider first. 
                   They’ll monitor you to make sure the medicines are working without causing negative side effects.</p>

  
  <h2> Types of anxiety disorders</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img width="1000px" src="img 1.jpg">
  </div>
  <p>There are several types of anxiety disorders according to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic 
    and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This is the standard reference manual for diagnosing mental 
    health conditions. Types of anxiety disorders include:</p>
    <ol class="bullet-list">
      <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD):</span>This condition causes fear,
         worry and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. It’s characterized by excessive, frequent and unrealistic 
         worry about everyday things, such as job responsibilities, health or chores.</li>
         <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Agoraphobia:</span>This condition causes an intense fear of becoming 
          overwhelmed or unable to escape or get help. People with agoraphobia often avoid new places and unfamiliar situations,
           like large, open areas or enclosed spaces, crowds and places outside of their homes.</li>
           <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Panic disorder: </span> This condition involves multiple unexpected panic attacks.
             A main feature of the condition is that the attacks usually happen without warning and aren’t due to another mental
              health or physical condition. Some people with panic disorder also have agoraphobia.</li>
              <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Specific phobias:  </span>A phobia is when something causes you to feel 
                fear or anxiety that’s so severe it consistently and overwhelmingly disrupts your life. 
                There are hundreds of different types of phobias, and there’s one diagnosis for almost all of them: 
                specific phobia. Only one phobia, agoraphobia, is a distinct diagnosis. </li>
                <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Social anxiety disorder:   </span> This condition 
                  (formerly known as social phobia) happens when you experience intense and ongoing fear of 
                  being judged negatively and/or watched by others.</li>
                  <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Separation anxiety disorder:</span>  This condition happens when you feel
                     excessive anxiety when you’re separated from a loved one, like a primary caregiver. 
                     While separation anxiety in babies and toddlers is a normal stage of development,
                      separation anxiety disorder can affect children and adults.</li>
                      <li><span style="color:darkblue;font-weight:bold;">Selective mutism:</span>This condition happens
                         when you don’t talk in certain situations because of fear or anxiety. It usually affects young 
                         children, but it can also affect adolescents and adults.
                         <p>Other mental health conditions share features with anxiety disorders. 
                          These include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder 
                          and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). But the American Psychiatric Association 
                          classifies them as distinct conditions and not anxiety disorders.</p>       
    </ol>
    <h2>Symptoms and Causes</h2>
    <h3>What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?</h3>
    <p>Symptoms of anxiety disorders vary depending on the type.</p>
    <p>Psychological symptoms may include:</p>
    <ol class="bullet-list">
      <li>Feeling panic, fear, dread and uneasiness.</li>
      <li>Feeling on edge or irritable.</li>
      <li>Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts.</li>
      <li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>
      <p>Physical symptoms may include:</p>
      <li>Restlessness.</li>
      <li>Heart palpitations.</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
      <li>Muscle tension.</li>
      <li>Cold or sweaty hands.</li>
      <li>Dry mouth.</li>
      <li>Nausea.</li>
      <li>Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet.</li>
      <li>Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional if you 
      frequently experience these symptoms.</p>
    
    <h2>What causes anxiety disorders?</h2>
    <p>Like other types of mental health conditions, researchers don’t know exactly
       what causes anxiety disorders. But they think a combination of factors plays a role:</p>
       <ol class="bullet-list">
        <li><span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">Chemical imbalances:</span>Several neurotransmitters 
          and hormones play a role in anxiety, including norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid
           (GABA). Imbalances in these chemicals can contribute to an anxiety disorder.</li>
          <li><span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">Brain changes:</span>A part of your brain
             called the amygdala plays an important role in managing fear and anxiety. Studies show that people
              with anxiety disorders show increased amygdala activity in response to anxiety cues.</li>
            <li><span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">Genetics:</span>Anxiety disorders tend 
              to run in biological families. This suggests that genetics may play a role. You may be at an 
              increased risk of developing one if you have a first-degree relative (biological parent or sibling)
               with an anxiety disorder.</li>
              <li><span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold;">Environmental factors:</span>Severe or
                 long-lasting stress can change the balance of neurotransmitters that control your mood.
                  Experiencing a lot of stress over a long period can contribute to an anxiety disorder.
                   Experiencing a traumatic event can also trigger anxiety disorders.</li>
                   </ol>
                
                   <h2>Living With</h2>
<h3>How can I take care of myself if I have an anxiety disorder?</h3>
<p>Aside from seeking professional medical help and treatment, 
  certain strategies can help you manage an anxiety disorder and make treatment more effective. They include:</p>
  <ol class="bullet-list">
    <li><span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Stress management</span> : Chronic or intense stress worsens anxiety disorders.
       Explore stress management techniques, like meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and regular exercise. </li>
       <li><span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Support groups</span> : Participating in a support group for people
         with anxiety — in-person
         or online — can
         provide opportunities to relate to others, share experiences and learn different coping strategies. </li>
       <li><span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Education</span> :Learning more about your condition and educating 
        loved ones can help you and them better understand the condition and offer support.  </li>
       <li><span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold;">Limiting or avoiding caffeine</span> : Caffeine can make the 
        physical symptoms of anxiety worse.
         Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re concerned about your level of caffeine consumption. </li>
  </ol>
  <h2>When should I see my healthcare provider?</h2>
  <p>Your healthcare provider is your partner in your care. If you feel like treatment for an anxiety disorder isn’t working 
    or have questions about your medication, contact your provider. Together, you can figure out how to best move forward.</p>
    <h2>A note from MindCare</h2>
    <p>You don’t need to live with constant worry and fear. If you notice symptoms of an anxiety disorder, talk to a healthcare provider. 
      It’s best to get diagnosed and treated as soon as possible. Doing so can limit the problems that anxiety disorders can cause. 
      Often, a combination of medications and counseling for anxiety can help you feel your best.</p>
